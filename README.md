## How to Use the Extension
I have a demo video here: https://youtu.be/CSqCguaFOug and I also have instructions written out below.

* When you go to maimmunizations.org, you will see a modal with instructions, which say: *"For this extension to be allowed to make noise, Google Chrome requires you to interact with the page before it can produce sounds. Please click anywhere on the page. It doesn't need to be a link â€“ you can click on any text, image, or blank white space on the page. Doing this will tell Chrome you allow sound. You will hear a test ringing noise first, to confirm you have allowed sound."* That modal looks like this:

* If you do click in the right place, you will see a success alert and hear a brief test noise:

  * Once you've seen this alert, you are all set.
* If you do not click somewhere on the page to give sound permissions, you will see:

* If you see the above, it means you still need to click somewhere (anywhere) on the page to give sound permissions to this extension
* When the www.maimmunizations.org page changes to show the Sign Up search form (or to show the pre-signup page, which apparently only sometimes shows up for people), you will hear five rings. When the website displays either of these pages, it means it's your turn, and that is when the extension will ring:
