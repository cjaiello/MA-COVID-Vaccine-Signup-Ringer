## Instructions
* When you go to maimmunizations.org, you will see a modal with instructions, which say:
"For this extension to be allowed to make noise, Google Chrome requires you to interact with the page before it can produce sounds. Please click anywhere on the page. It doesn't need to be a link â€“ you can click on any text, image, or blank white space on the page. Doing this will tell Chrome you allow sound. You will hear a test ringing noise first, to confirm you have allowed sound."
