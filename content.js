/*
* At a high level, this Chrome Extension checks if we are on 
* the MA Immunizations Website, checks if the user has given
* this browser tab permissions to make sounds yet, and if they
* have, checks every few seconds to see if the current page is
* the signup page rather than the lobby page.
*
*
* The Nitty Gritty:
* If we are on the MA Immunizations Website, this extension
* checks to see if the user has seen the welcome message for this
* Chrome extension before. If they have already seen it, we don't 
* show it. If they have not seen it yet, we show it.
*
* This extension then sees if, during this browser session, the user
* has given us permissions to play sounds. Sound permission must be 
* given via clicking anywhere on the page. If they have not yet given 
* us sound permission, we will try to play the test sound (which will 
* alert them to click on something to give us sound permissions).
* If during this session they HAVE triggered the test sound already,
* meaning we have been given sound permissions, we just immediately
* start the interval to check over and over if we are on the test page.
* The `hasSuccessfullyTriggeredTestSound` is cleared once the browser
* closes, but it persists between refreshes (which is necessary because
* the MA Immunizations Website refreshes itself over and over.)
*
* Once we know we have permission to make sounds, this extension
* repeatedly checks to see if the page is currently displaying
* the sign up functionality. If it is, it rings and pops an alert modal.
